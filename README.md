Server monitoring notifies you of outages and tracks server performance. Reduce time to repair issues with root cause analysis capabilities and take corrective actions. Monitor Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD servers and more. 

Plugins are a great way to customize and measure attributes and keep track of data that matters the most. We support Redis, MySQL, MongoDB, NGINX, HAProxy, ZooKeeper, WordPRess, Apache and Zombie Process plugins in the latest version of the Linux monitoring agent. Just install the latest Linux agent on the server and the plugins will automatically detect any MySQL or Redis instances configured in the server and add a plugins monitor in the server monitoring dashboard of your Site24x7 client. Additionally, users can write their own script and monitor customized attributes tracking critical metrics and set thresholds for individual attributes and configure alerts. Support for adding out of the box Nagios plugins is also extended.

Use free plugins to monitor unlimited attributes with unlimited plugin monitors.
